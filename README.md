# CIF Magento's extensions

Magento Extensions that are used for [CIF](https://github.com/adobe/commerce-cif-magento).

## AggregatedServices
   
 **AggregatedServices** module provides additional web API endpoints that enables [CIF](https://github.com/adobe/commerce-cif-magento) to query for data using fewer number of requests.
 One example is the `guest-aggregated-carts` endpoint that return the entire cart information including cart totals, product and product attributes definitions.
 
 For the full Magento REST API documentation please refer to the one on [Magento 2.2] (https://devdocs.magento.com).
