# CIF Magento's extensions

Magento Extensions that are used for [CIF](https://github.com/adobe/commerce-cif-magento).

## AggregatedServices
   
 **AggregatedServices** module provides additional web API endpoints that enables [CIF](https://github.com/adobe/commerce-cif-magento) to query for data using fewer number of requests.
